Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ping Pong bot coded in Bot Commander for Discord. My source code is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Gl1tch3dL1m3/ping-pong-bcfd/tree/main). Feel free to copy use it in whatever you want!

**Commands:**
`pp!help` - This message.
`pp!request <user>` - Send a match request to a user.
`pp!ping <user>` - Ping a ball to your opponent.
`pp!finish <user>` - Finish your current match or delete your request.

*<> is a required parameter.*
