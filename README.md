# Ping Pong in BCFD
Welcome to the source code! Feel free to use these scripts in any project you want.

__Steps:__
1. Create these commands:

   (Put **Embed Message** everywhere)
- request (Phrase ON, Reaction: ✅)
- request (Phrase ON, Reaction: ❌)
- ping (Phrase ON)
- finish (Phrase ON)
- ✅ (Event: Reaction Add)
- ❌ (Event: Reaction Add)
- help

2. Insert scripts - don't forget to follow the instructions on each one!

__v1.1:__
- add singleplayer command (Pharse OFF)
- insert `singleplayer.js`
- update ping command with `ping.js`
- update finish command with `finish.js`

Sorry if this isn't good for you, but this is probably the maximum I can do in BCFD. :)
